Salary Prediction using Linear Regression This project aims to predict salaries based on various input features using machine learning techniques. By employing linear regression, the project showcases how predictive modeling can be applied to real-world datasets. 
# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Description
This project predicts salaries based on input features such as years of experience, education level, and other relevant factors. By applying a Linear Regression model, the project demonstrates the use of machine learning in solving regression problems.

The dataset used is a fictional "Salary Data" CSV file. The project walks through essential steps such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, providing an end-to-end solution for salary prediction.

## Features
- Import and preprocess data from a CSV file.
- Visualize data distributions and relationships using `matplotlib`.
- Train a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate the model's performance with metrics like:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (RÂ²) score.
